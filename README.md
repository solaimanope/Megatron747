# Megatron747

Currently there are 5 bots implemented in Megatron747.cpp

bot0 -> plays randomly

bot11 -> tries to maximize the number of atoms in exactly one move

bot14 -> tries to maximize the number of atoms in exactly one move

bot21 -> 3 steps deeper with bot11

bot31 -> arbitrary steps deeper with bot21. The number of steps will be determined from time limit.
